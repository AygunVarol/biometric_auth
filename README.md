# Biometric Authentication App

## A biometric authentication app for consumer devices that uses facial recognition to grant access. Drawing on lessons from the incident, this project would explore enhanced facial feature detection—potentially incorporating additional biometric cues (e.g., voice, blink detection)—to reduce false matches.

The biometric authentication app is structured using a Flask-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. The main application file 'app.py' serves as the entry point, handling route configurations and initializing core services. It connects to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM for storing user profiles and biometric templates. 'models.py' defines the database schema, including User and BiometricData tables with relationships for facial recognition data and additional biometric markers. 'facial_recognition.py' implements the core facial detection and matching algorithms using OpenCV and dlib libraries, incorporating enhanced feature detection and anti-spoofing measures like blink detection. 'biometric_service.py' manages the multi-modal biometric processing pipeline, coordinating between facial recognition and additional biometric verification methods (voice, liveness detection). 'auth_controller.py' handles the authentication flow, session management, and security policies, implementing rate limiting and audit logging. The system uses a Redis cache for temporary storage of authentication attempts and session data. The application employs a modular architecture where each biometric component (face, voice) is implemented as a separate service that can be independently scaled or modified. Data flow begins at the client interface, passes through authentication controllers, is processed by the biometric services, and results are persisted in the PostgreSQL database. The system uses SQLAlchemy's connection pooling for efficient database operations and implements proper connection handling with automatic cleanup.
