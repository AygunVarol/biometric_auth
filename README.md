# biometric_auth
A biometric authentication app for consumer devices that uses facial recognition to grant access. Drawing on lessons from the incident, this project would explore enhanced facial feature detection—potentially incorporating additional biometric cues (e.g., voice, blink detection)—to reduce false matches.
